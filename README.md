# Charitable Application Designs

**Task:** Create wireframe and mockups for a charity application which allows users to be able to donate to a charity of their choice 

**Owner Notes:** This was an assigned task for my 'Mobile Application Development Course' Course in my fourth year of University. This carried on from my applications, development and modelling course from second year and I thought it was so exciting to be able to utilise my existing skills and knowledge of Figma. It was doubly exciting to be able to see my skills develop further within the realm of designing interfaces for mobile application. In order to see the complete flow and user interactions, I have included some links (see below).
